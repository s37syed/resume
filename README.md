# Awesome CV [![Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/example-pdf-green.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/master/examples/resume.pdf)


[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **resume** or **cover letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.


## Custom
This is a modified resume by Shah Syed. It deviates from an old version of @posquit0's Awesome-CV and features changes that, at the time, weren't implemented (such as theming elements for colouring entire words). 

## Development Instructions
Mac OS X - Install BasicTex. Get TeX Live and install all dependancies for project. Install TeXMaker and edit .Tex Files. Compile using XeLaTeX and export as PDF.
